## Getting Started

This README provides a brief overview of the contents and instructions on how to explore the examples.

### Prerequisites

* **Python:** Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download it from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* **pip:** pip is the package installer for Python. It usually comes bundled with Python installations. You can check if you have it by running `pip --version` in your terminal.
* **Database Drivers (if applicable):** For the database examples in the `db` directory, you might need to install specific database drivers depending on the database you are trying to connect to. For example:
    * **MySQL:** `pip install mysql-connector-python`
    * **PostgreSQL:** `pip install psycopg2`
    * **SQLite:** Python usually comes with built-in support for SQLite, so no extra installation is typically needed.

## Exploring the Examples

### `db/` Directory: Database Connection Examples

This directory contains sample Python scripts that demonstrate how to connect to different types of databases.

1.  **Navigate to the `db` directory:**

    ```bash
    cd python/db
    ```

2.  **Examine the scripts:** Look at the available Python files (e.g., `connect_sqlite.py`, `connect_mysql.py`). Each script will likely contain code illustrating the steps to:
    * Import the necessary database connector library.
    * Establish a connection to the database using connection parameters (host, user, password, database name, etc.).
    * Execute basic database operations (e.g., creating tables, inserting data, querying data).
    * Handle potential errors.
    * Close the database connection.

3.  **Run the scripts:** To run a specific example, use the Python interpreter:

    ```bash
    python connect_sqlite.py  # Replace with the actual script name
    ```

    **Note:** You will need to have a database set up and potentially modify the connection parameters within the scripts to match your local database configuration. Refer to the comments within each script for specific instructions and any required setup.

### `oops/` Directory: Object-Oriented Programming Examples (Future)

This directory will eventually contain Python scripts demonstrating various Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, such as:

* Classes and Objects
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism
* Encapsulation
* Abstraction

Once these examples are added, you can navigate to this directory (`cd python/oops`) and run the scripts (`python inheritance.py`, etc.) to see these concepts in action.
